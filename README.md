# CET313 - Artificial Intelligence Project  
**Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment**  

## üìå Project Overview  
A machine learning system to predict equipment failures using sensor data, achieving **98% accuracy** with Random Forest.  

---

## üìÇ Weekly Progress  

### Week 1: Project Proposal  
- Selected NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset  
- Defined project scope and objectives  

### Week 2: Data Exploration  
- Analyzed distributions of sensor readings  
- Identified key correlations:  
  - `power` (rpm √ó torque) ‚Üí -0.45 with failure  
  - `temp_diff` ‚Üí 0.02 with failure  

### Week 3: Data Preprocessing  
- One-hot encoded categorical features (`Type`, `Failure Type`)  
- Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`  
- Train-test split (80/20)  

### Week 4: Feature Engineering  
- Created new features:  
  - `power` = Rotational speed √ó Torque  
  - `temp_diff` = Process temp - Air temp  
  - Time-based wear rate   

### Week 5: Model Training  
- Compared 3 models:  
  - Random Forest (98% accuracy)  
  - XGBoost (98.2%)  
  - Neural Network (97.5%)  
- Selected Random Forest after hyperparameter tuning   

### Week 6: Model Evaluation  
- Key metrics:  
  - AUC-ROC: 0.99  
  - Recall (Failure class): 85%  

### Week 7: Report Drafting  
- Generated technical report with:  
  - Methodology  
  - Results visualization  
  - Deployment recommendations  

### Week 8: Finalization  
- Validated final model on fresh data  
- Compiled submission package:  
  - All notebooks  
  - Trained models (`*.pkl`)  
  - Final report
