## üìÇ Weekly Progress  

### Week 1: Project Proposal  
- Selected NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset  
- Defined project scope and objectives  
- [Notebook](Week1_ProjectProposal.ipynb)  

### Week 2: Data Exploration  
- Analyzed distributions of sensor readings  
- Identified key correlations:  
  - `power` (rpm √ó torque) ‚Üí -0.45 with failure  
  - `temp_diff` ‚Üí 0.02 with failure  
- [Notebook](Week2_DataExploration.ipynb)  

### Week 3: Data Preprocessing  
- One-hot encoded categorical features (`Type`, `Failure Type`)  
- Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`  
- Train-test split (80/20)  
- [Notebook](Week3_DataPreprocessing.ipynb)  

### Week 4: Feature Engineering  
- Created new features:  
  - `power` = Rotational speed √ó Torque  
  - `temp_diff` = Process temp - Air temp  
  - Time-based wear rate  
- [Notebook](Week4_FeatureEngineering.ipynb)  

### Week 5: Model Training  
- Compared 3 models:  
  - Random Forest (98% accuracy)  
  - XGBoost (98.2%)  
  - Neural Network (97.5%)  
- Selected Random Forest after hyperparameter tuning  
- [Notebook](Week5_ModelTraining.ipynb)  

### Week 6: Model Evaluation  
- Key metrics:  
  - AUC-ROC: 0.99  
  - Recall (Failure class): 85%  
- [Notebook](Week6_ModelEvaluation.ipynb)  
![Confusion Matrix](confusion_matrix.png)  

### Week 7: Report Drafting  
- Generated technical report with:  
  - Methodology  
  - Results visualization  
  - Deployment recommendations  
- [Report Draft](draft_report.md)  

### Week 8: Finalization
